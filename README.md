# pokedex
A pokemon encyclopedia

#### Review May 2025

Listing down Ui and performance issues noticed  

1. Pokemon details page has no back navigation button
2. Pokemon region page loader vanishes and there a blank section before card loads
3. Two types of loaders at diffenent pages, improve styling of loader
4. Home page - except the cards everything looks very basic
5. Can we make the footer sticky, it is getting lost at the bottom !! - Makes sense for homepage not for list page
6. Region/Legendary pokemon's list is long and we can have a CTA for "go to top" action
7. Improve the header 
8. Improve the search
9. Optional - Can we improve on the About me page ?!
10. Get a better font
11. Better error screens
12. Need data caching
13. Add theme - pikachu theme etc.
